A common trend in distributed computing is the mass execution of small
homogeneous processes. This pattern is prevalent in big data processing, and
micro service based architectures. A key tenant of these processes is minimal
statem, A consequence largely due to the complexities of designing massive
systems which coordinate stateful behavior. Here we propose a technique for
analyzing the stateful behavior of thousands of homogeneous processes, over
many executions. Our analysis composes the logs of all processes into a single
aggregate state machine. This model is replicated in a runtime, and is used to
simulate new executions which are checked for specified safety and liveness
properties. We propose two models for constructing aggregate state machines.
First a theoretical model which generates no false positives, but which is
constrained to minimal systems. Second a pragmatic model for large systems
which permits false positives. Our second model is paired with additional novel
analysis which orders false positives by their likelihood to be real
violations.
