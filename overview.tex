\section{Overview}

An increasing common trend in distributed computing is the mass execution of
small process. This pattern is prevalent in big data processing, and micro
service based architectures. A key tenant of these processes is minimal or non
existent state. This property is largely due to the complexities of designing
massive systems which can coordinate stateful behavior. Here we propose a
technique for analyzing the stateful behavior of thousands of homogeneous
processes, over many executions. Our analysis aggregates the logs of processes
from 1 or more executions, and composes them into an aggregate state machine.
These models are replicated in a runtime, and simulate executions which are
checked for safety and liveness properties.

Further we propose a relaxed model for state machine construction which
produces smaller, faster to check models, with a dramatized level of false
positives.
