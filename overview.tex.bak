\section{Overview}

An increasing common trend in distributed computing is the mass execution of
small proccess. This pattern is prevelent in big data processing, and micro
service based archetectures. A key tennat of these processes is minimal or non
existant state. This property is largly due to the complexities of designing
massive systems which can coordinate stateful behaviour. Here we propose a
technique for analyzing the stateful behaviour of thousands of homogeneous
processes, over many executions. Our analysis aggregates the logs of processes
from 1 or more executions, and composes them into an aggreate state machine.
These models are replicated in a runtime, and simulate executions which are
checked for safty and liveness properteis.

Further we propose a relaxed model for state machine construction which
produces smaller, faster to check models, with a paramatrized level of false
positives.
